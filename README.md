This repository is a conceptual research prototype.
References to "AGI" and "superintelligence" describe aspirational goals and do not indicate the presence of a real
general intelligence. Use at your own risk. Nothing herein constitutes financial advice. MontrealAI and the maintainers
accept no liability for losses incurred from using this software.

**Ready to explore? [Launch the α‑AGI Insight demo](https://montrealai.github.io/AGI-Alpha-Agent-v0/alpha_agi_insight_v1/) to see it in action.**

### Security Note

This project intentionally avoids reliance on Chainlink VRF or similar third-party subscription services. Randomness and related features are derived locally so the system remains self-contained and auditable.

### Continuous Integration

[![PR CI](https://github.com/montrealai/AGI-Alpha-Agent-v0/actions/workflows/pr-ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/montrealai/AGI-Alpha-Agent-v0/actions/workflows/pr-ci.yml)
[![🚀 Integration CI — Insight Demo](https://github.com/montrealai/AGI-Alpha-Agent-v0/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/montrealai/AGI-Alpha-Agent-v0/actions/workflows/ci.yml?query=branch%3Amain)
[![🔥 Smoke Test](https://github.com/montrealai/AGI-Alpha-Agent-v0/actions/workflows/smoke.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/montrealai/AGI-Alpha-Agent-v0/actions/workflows/smoke.yml)
[![🩺 CI Health](https://github.com/montrealai/AGI-Alpha-Agent-v0/actions/workflows/ci-health.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/montrealai/AGI-Alpha-Agent-v0/actions/workflows/ci-health.yml)

The CI matrix is pinned to the canonical `$AGIALPHA` token contract (`0xa61a3b3a130a9c20768eebf97e21515a6046a1fa`, **18 decimals**). Each workflow calls `python scripts/check_agialpha_config.py` to fail fast if the address, decimals, or workflow environment variables drift away from [`token.config.js`](token.config.js) or the Solidity constants. Run the same helper locally before dispatching CI to keep badges green and avoid PR surprises.

The **canonical pull-request gate** is **✅ PR CI**. It runs Ruff plus the focused smoke test suite on pull requests, pushes to `main`, and merge queue runs.

The full **🚀 Integration CI — Insight Demo** workflow is intentionally **off the PR path**. It runs on pushes to `main`, release tags (`v*` / `release-*`), and manual dispatch for maintainers. Push-to-main runs the full non-release validation matrix (actionlint, Ruff+Mypy matrix, pytest matrix, Insight Browser ESLint, Windows/macOS smoke, MkDocs, Docs Build, Docker build validation, and branch-protection guardrails). Tags/manual dispatch add release-only publish/deploy/signing stages.

**🩺 CI Health** hard-monitors the canonical required surface (✅ PR CI) and hard-monitors 🚀 Integration CI for merge-surface contexts. `workflow_run` watchdog executions remain rerun-only (no extra dispatch) because the upstream run already exists; scheduled/manual runs enforce both PR and merge surfaces with missing-run dispatch enabled. Self-monitoring remains opt-in (`--include-self`), and rerun support helps Repo-Healer progress beyond run-attempt-1 report-only triage. `ADMIN_GITHUB_TOKEN` enables branch-protection remediation while default tokens stay read-only for admin APIs.

#### Run CI locally

1. Create and activate a Python 3.11–3.13 virtual environment, then upgrade pip:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   pip install -U pip
   ```
2. Install required and optional Python dependencies (set `ALPHA_FACTORY_FULL=1` for heavier extras or `--wheelhouse <dir>` when offline):
   ```bash
   python check_env.py --auto-install
   ```
3. Run formatting and lint hooks:
   ```bash
   pre-commit run --all-files
   ```
4. Execute the tests:
   ```bash
   pytest
   ```
5. Trigger workflows from GitHub Actions when needed:
   - **✅ PR CI** validates PR gate behavior.
   - **🚀 Integration CI — Insight Demo** validates the full post-merge/release matrix.

Set branch protection required checks to:

- `✅ PR CI / Lint (ruff)`
- `✅ PR CI / Smoke tests`

Keep **Require branches to be up to date** enabled. Verify protections with:

```bash
python scripts/verify_branch_protection.py --apply --branch main
```

Track workflow health with:

```bash
python scripts/check_ci_status.py --wait-minutes 5 --stale-minutes 90 --pending-grace-minutes 45
# add --dispatch-failed only for explicit remediation runs
```

See [`docs/CI_ENFORCEMENT.md`](docs/CI_ENFORCEMENT.md) for the up-to-date enforcement checklist.

### Quick Demo

Non-technical users can try the project with zero setup. Simply visit
<https://montrealai.github.io/AGI-Alpha-Agent-v0/alpha_agi_insight_v1/> in your
browser. The [README](docs/README.md#α‑agi-insight-v1-demo) explains how this
demo is built and deployed.

See [Quick Deployment](docs/HOSTING_INSTRUCTIONS.md#quick-deployment) for build and deployment details. The [📚 Docs workflow](.github/workflows/docs.yml) is dispatched manually by the repository owner to publish the updated site to GitHub Pages.

Full documentation: [https://montrealai.github.io/AGI-Alpha-Agent-v0/](https://montrealai.github.io/AGI-Alpha-Agent-v0/) (use the **Docs** link in the navigation bar)

The GitHub Pages site hosts the interactive demo under the `alpha_agi_insight_v1/` directory. Click **Docs** in the navigation bar for the full manual.

**View the interactive demo here:** <https://montrealai.github.io/AGI-Alpha-Agent-v0/alpha_agi_insight_v1/>

**Browse the visual demo gallery:** <https://montrealai.github.io/AGI-Alpha-Agent-v0/>

**Explore all demos:** <https://montrealai.github.io/AGI-Alpha-Agent-v0/alpha_factory_v1/demos/> – run `./scripts/open_subdir_gallery.py` (or set `AF_GALLERY_URL` to your own mirror) for a local or online launch. Alternatively execute `make subdir-gallery-open` to build the gallery if needed and open it automatically.
All browser demos include a **mode toggle**. Choose **Offline** to run a Pyodide simulation directly in your browser or switch to **OpenAI API** when you provide a key. The key is stored only in memory.

### Smoke Test Workflow

Trigger the **🔥 Smoke Test** job from the GitHub Actions tab to run linting,
unit tests and a short 2‑year simulation in offline mode. The workflow verifies
the ledger output and catches import errors or circular dependencies early.

**Important:** Run `npm run fetch-assets` before `npm install` or executing
`./setup.sh` to download the browser demo assets. Run this command in a fresh
checkout—or delete existing `wasm*/` files first—so placeholder files are
replaced. After the download, verify checksums with
`python scripts/fetch_assets.py --verify-only`. The helper retrieves the
official Pyodide runtime from the jsDelivr CDN and the GPT‑2 small checkpoint
directly from the Hugging Face CDN. The legacy `wasm-gpt2.tar` bundle is no longer used.
Override `HF_GPT2_BASE_URL`
to change the mirror, for example:

```bash
export HF_GPT2_BASE_URL="https://huggingface.co/openai-community/gpt2/resolve/main"
```

If `npm run fetch-assets` fails with a 401 or 404 error, download the GPT‑2
files manually:
```bash
python scripts/download_hf_gpt2.py models/gpt2
```
Each file can also be fetched individually using these official links:
```bash
curl -O https://huggingface.co/openai-community/gpt2/resolve/main/pytorch_model.bin
curl -O https://huggingface.co/openai-community/gpt2/resolve/main/vocab.json
curl -O https://huggingface.co/openai-community/gpt2/resolve/main/merges.txt
curl -O https://huggingface.co/openai-community/gpt2/resolve/main/config.json
```
The model weights have SHA‑256
`7c5d3f4b8b76583b422fcb9189ad6c89d5d97a094541ce8932dce3ecabde1421` for
verification. See
[insight_browser_v1/index.md](alpha_factory_v1/demos/alpha_agi_insight_v1/insight_browser_v1/index.md)
for additional details.

[![Launch \u03b1\u2011AGI Insight](https://img.shields.io/badge/Launch-%CE%B1%E2%80%91AGI%20Insight-blue?style=for-the-badge)](https://montrealai.github.io/AGI-Alpha-Agent-v0/alpha_agi_insight_v1/)

### Manual Deployment

The repository owner triggers the [Docs workflow](.github/workflows/docs.yml) from the GitHub Actions tab. Simply click **Run workflow** to start the deployment. The job runs [`scripts/edge_human_knowledge_pages_sprint.sh`](scripts/edge_human_knowledge_pages_sprint.sh) to rebuild the Insight demo and MkDocs site, publishing the result to GitHub Pages. Once it finishes the live demo is available at <https://montrealai.github.io/AGI-Alpha-Agent-v0/alpha_agi_insight_v1/>.

### Publish Demo Gallery

Ensure **Python 3.11–3.13** (<3.14) and **Node 22.17.1** are installed, then deploy the gallery
and docs with a single command:

```bash
make gallery-deploy
```
`make gallery-deploy` wraps [`scripts/deploy_gallery_pages.sh`](scripts/deploy_gallery_pages.sh),
which calls [`scripts/generate_gallery_html.py`](scripts/generate_gallery_html.py)
to refresh `docs/index.html` and update the `docs/gallery.html` redirect.

See [docs/GITHUB_PAGES_DEMO_TASKS.md](docs/GITHUB_PAGES_DEMO_TASKS.md) for a
detailed walkthrough. Once the build finishes, open the gallery locally with:

```bash
make gallery-open
```

Run `make gallery-build` to regenerate the site without deploying and open it
in one step.

Open an individual demo directly:

```bash
make demo-open DEMO=alpha_agi_business_v1
```

### Edge-of-Human-Knowledge Sprint

Run the wrapper to build and deploy the full GitHub Pages site with environment
checks and offline validation. Use the shell or Python version:

```bash
./scripts/edge_human_knowledge_pages_sprint.sh
python scripts/edge_human_knowledge_pages_sprint.py
```

Ensure **Python 3.11–3.13** (<3.14), **Node 22.17.1** and `mkdocs` are installed. The
script mirrors the [Docs workflow](.github/workflows/docs.yml) used for manual
deployment.

### Browser Size Workflow

The [📦 Browser Size](.github/workflows/size-check.yml) job ensures the
Insight archive stays under 500 MiB (with a 750 MiB hard cap). Open **Actions → 📦 Browser Size** and click
**Run workflow** to start the check. Repository owners can leave `run_token`
blank. Others must provide the `run_token` that matches the `DISPATCH_TOKEN`
secret. The workflow caches pip and npm dependencies using
`actions/setup-python` and `actions/setup-node`. Node uses `cache-dependency-path` to reference
`alpha_factory_v1/demos/alpha_agi_insight_v1/insight_browser_v1/package-lock.json`,
`alpha_factory_v1/core/interface/web_client/package-lock.json`,
`alpha_factory_v1/core/interface/web_client/staking/package-lock.json` and
`alpha_factory_v1/demos/alpha_agi_insight_v1/src/interface/web_client/package-lock.json` so repeat runs
skip redundant downloads and avoid the “Dependencies lock file is not found”
warning. `ci.yml` stores these paths in the `NODE_LOCKFILES` environment
variable so every `setup-node` step uses the same list. It
applies the same paths for the tests, docs-build and Docker jobs. It
preinstalls `numpy`, `pandas`, `pytest` and `PyYAML` so the environment check
passes without network hiccups. During the run it also updates the
`browserslist` cache inside
`alpha_factory_v1/demos/alpha_agi_insight_v1/insight_browser_v1` **and**
`alpha_factory_v1/core/interface/web_client` using
`update-browserslist-db` to ensure the generated assets target the latest
browsers. When running offline or if the update fails, set
`BROWSERSLIST_IGNORE_OLD_DATA=true` to continue without refreshing the cache.
Update the version in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and rerun
`npx update-browserslist-db --update-db --yes` whenever dependencies change.

### CI Workflow

The [🚀 Integration CI](.github/workflows/ci.yml) workflow verifies the Insight demo with
linting, type checks, unit tests and a Docker build. Open **Actions → 🚀 Integration CI — Insight Demo**, select the branch or tag to test in the drop‑down and click
**Run workflow** to dispatch the pipeline. This workflow also runs
automatically on pushes to `main` and release tags (`v*`, `release-*`), while
staying off pull requests. Push-to-main runs now execute the full non-release
validation matrix, while release tags/manual dispatch append publish/deploy tasks. Each job begins
by verifying the actor matches the repository owner only for manual dispatches;
push and tag runs execute automatically for normal integration validation.
Because the first job checks `${{ github.actor }}` against `${{ github.repository_owner }}`,
you must own the repository to run the workflow from manual dispatch.
Jobs following the main test stage include `if: always()` so the Windows and
macOS smoke tests, documentation build and Docker jobs execute even when the
lint or unit tests fail. This behavior helps confirm that cross‑platform builds
and docs generation succeed while debugging failures.
Dependency hashes are fully locked, including `setuptools`, so `pip install -r
requirements.lock` succeeds across Python versions. The Windows smoke job now
builds the Insight browser before running tests, ensuring the service worker is
present for the cache version check. Browser assets are cached across jobs using
a deterministic hash derived from the expected checksums, so later stages reuse
the same files. The docs and Docker jobs automatically fetch any missing assets
and open a pull request when checksums drift. See
[CI_WORKFLOW.md](docs/CI_WORKFLOW.md) for a detailed job overview.
All Node.js steps pin the same lockfiles via `cache-dependency-path` so
`actions/setup-node` caches npm packages correctly and avoids "Dependencies lock
file is not found" warnings. The paths are:
```
alpha_factory_v1/demos/alpha_agi_insight_v1/insight_browser_v1/package-lock.json
alpha_factory_v1/core/interface/web_client/package-lock.json
alpha_factory_v1/core/interface/web_client/staking/package-lock.json
alpha_factory_v1/demos/alpha_agi_insight_v1/src/interface/web_client/package-lock.json
```
To publish a release, create a Git tag and run the same workflow on that
tag. The Docker job pushes the `agi-insight-demo` image to GitHub Container
Registry while the deploy stage attaches the built web client archive to a
GitHub release. If any later step fails the workflow automatically restores
the previous `latest` tag to avoid shipping a broken image.

### Build & Test Workflow

The [🐳 Build & Test](.github/workflows/build-and-test.yml) job runs linting,
tests and container builds. Open **Actions → 🐳 Build & Test** and click
**Run workflow** to start the pipeline. Only the repository owner can run this
workflow. Each job verifies the actor first and exits immediately for
non‑owners, keeping the rest of the jobs from being skipped.
See [ADMIN_ACTIONS.md](docs/ADMIN_ACTIONS.md) for details on the manual
workflow restrictions and protected environments.

Docker image tags must use all lowercase characters. The workflow's
"Prepare lowercase image name" step sets `REPO_OWNER_LC` to the lowercased
repository owner so tags like `ghcr.io/montrealai` are valid.

### CI Quick Start

To replicate the CI pipeline locally:

```bash
python scripts/check_python_deps.py
python check_env.py --auto-install
pytest --cov --cov-report=xml
pre-commit run --all-files
```

Launch the integration workflow manually via **Actions → 🚀 Integration CI — Insight Demo** and click
**Run workflow** as described in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md#starting-the-ci-pipeline).
The workflow performs linting, type checks, the full unit test matrix on Python
3.11 and 3.12, Windows and macOS smoke tests, documentation builds, Docker
builds and an optional deploy step for tagged releases.

### Verify Docker image signature

The release workflow signs the container using [cosign](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign).
Validate the signature before deploying a new version:

```bash
cosign verify ghcr.io/montrealai/agi-insight-demo:latest
```
Successful verification proves the image came from this repository's CI.

## Quickstart

```bash
./quickstart.sh
# or using Docker
docker compose up --build
# or one-click image
./run_quickstart.sh
```

Run `npm run fetch-assets` before `npm install` or executing `./setup.sh` to
download the Insight demo assets. Delete any old `wasm*/` directories or start
from a clean checkout so placeholders are replaced. After fetching, verify the
files with `python scripts/fetch_assets.py --verify-only`. The helper retrieves
the official Pyodide runtime from the jsDelivr CDN and the GPT‑2 small
checkpoint from Hugging Face.
Override `HF_GPT2_BASE_URL` or `PYODIDE_BASE_URL` to use alternate mirrors. See
[insight_browser_v1/index.md](alpha_factory_v1/demos/alpha_agi_insight_v1/insight_browser_v1/index.md)
for a detailed guide. You can also run `python scripts/download_gpt2_small.py`
to retrieve the model directly:

```bash
python scripts/download_gpt2_small.py models/
# downloads https://huggingface.co/openai-community/gpt2/resolve/main/pytorch_model.bin ...
```

As a last resort use `python scripts/download_openai_gpt2.py 124M`.

Requires **Python 3.11–3.13 (<3.14)** and **Docker Compose ≥2.5**.

Alternatively, run the pre-built image directly:
```bash
docker run --pull=always -p 8000:8000 ghcr.io/montrealai/alpha-factory:latest
```

The workflow publishes a separate image for each Python version with tags
`py311`, `py312` and `py313`. Only the Python **3.13** build also
updates the `latest` tag so
`ghcr.io/montrealai/alpha-factory:latest` always refers to the most recent
Python 3.13 image.

> **Note**
> The Dockerfiles in this repository pin the base image to Python 3.13.
> Keep this in sync with the highest Python version listed in the CI
> matrix when updating workflows.

Replace `latest` with a commit SHA to run that exact build:

```bash
docker run --pull=always -p 8000:8000 ghcr.io/montrealai/alpha-factory:<commit>
```

Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` and other required secrets in your environment or `.env`
before launching the container. The orchestrator prints the
[project disclaimer](docs/DISCLAIMER_SNIPPET.md) when it starts.

**Supported OS:** Ubuntu 22.04+, Debian 12+, macOS 12+ and Windows 11 via
**WSL 2** (recommended for Windows users). Native Windows paths frequently break
volume mounts. Clone this repository inside the WSL file system to avoid these
issues.

```powershell
wsl --install
wsl --set-default-version 2
wsl --update
# enable "Use the WSL 2 based engine" in Docker Desktop
```
Clone the repository inside your WSL home directory to avoid path translation errors.

## Humanity’s Structured Rise to Economic Supremacy via Strategic AGI Mastery

### 🎖️ α‑AGI Insight 👁️✨ — Beyond Human Foresight
Where human foresight reaches its limits, α‑AGI Insight sees beyond. Humanity stands at the precipice of history’s most
profound economic transformation. α‑AGI Insight identifies with pinpoint accuracy those sectors poised for imminent
disruption by Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). With authoritative and rigorously validated projections estimating
economic opportunities surpassing **$15 Quadrillion (15 000 trillion USD)**, today’s strategic anticipation unlocks
extraordinary economic advantages tomorrow.

* **Precision Forecasting** — Identify and proactively engage critical sectors before AGI disruption.  
* **First‑Mover Advantage** — Maximize returns through strategic foresight and superior positioning.
A static demo is available via [GitHub Pages](https://montrealai.github.io/AGI-Alpha-Agent-v0/alpha_agi_insight_v1/).
See [Quick Deployment](docs/HOSTING_INSTRUCTIONS.md#quick-deployment) for guidance on building the docs and publishing your own copy.

### 🎖️ α‑AGI Sovereign 👁️✨ — Autonomous Economic Transformation
Meta‑Agentic mastery at global scale. α‑AGI Sovereign represents a revolutionary class of autonomous, blockchain‑based
enterprises deploying advanced Meta‑Agentic frameworks. Through dynamically evolving swarms of intelligent agents, these
enterprises systematically identify and transform global inefficiencies into measurable economic value (“$AGIALPHA”),
fundamentally reshaping market dynamics and strategically realigning global economic structures.

* **α‑AGI Marketplace 👁️✨** — Decentralized global platform matching strategic AGI tasks with optimal execution.  
  * **α‑AGI Jobs 👁️✨** — Autonomous missions precisely targeting identified inefficiencies.  
  * **α‑AGI Agents 👁️✨** — Adaptive, self‑optimizing intelligent agents executing α‑Jobs, yielding immediate economic
    returns.

Strategic Edge:

* Decentralized autonomy ensures superior agility and resilience.
* Strategically validated methodologies guarantee consistent economic leadership.

## Quick Start
**Local:** `./quickstart.sh` &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; **Docker:** `docker compose up --build`

An interactive Colab notebook demonstrates the same zero‑data Insight search loop. Open
[colab_alpha_agi_insight_v1.ipynb](alpha_factory_v1/demos/alpha_agi_insight_v1/colab_alpha_agi_insight_v1.ipynb) in
Google Colab to try it online.

Clone the repository at the `v0.1.0-alpha` tag and run the helper script to start the Insight demo locally:

```bash
git clone --branch v0.1.0-alpha https://github.com/MontrealAI/AGI-Alpha-Agent-v0.git
cd AGI-Alpha-Agent-v0
python -c "import alpha_factory_v1; print(alpha_factory_v1.__version__)"  # prints 0.1.0-alpha
python check_env.py --auto-install  # may run for several minutes
# NumPy and pandas are required for realistic results; omit or add
# `--allow-basic-fallback` to bypass this check.
# Abort with Ctrl+C and rerun with '--timeout 300' to fail fast
./quickstart.sh
Run `pre-commit run --all-files` after the dependencies finish installing.
```

Offline example using a local wheelhouse:

```bash
WHEELHOUSE=$(pwd)/wheels AUTO_INSTALL_MISSING=1 ./quickstart.sh
```

If the default mirrors are blocked, set `PYODIDE_BASE_URL` or
`HF_GPT2_BASE_URL` before running `npm run fetch-assets`:

```bash
export PYODIDE_BASE_URL="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/pyodide/v0.28.0/full"
export HF_GPT2_BASE_URL="https://huggingface.co/openai-community/gpt2/resolve/main"
npm run fetch-assets
```

Or launch the full stack with Docker:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

### Minimal Install

The default `requirements.txt` pulls in a lean set of packages for the
offline demos and tests:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Full Feature Install

Install the heavier extras for finance, graph back‑ends and large
language models:

```bash
pip install -r alpha_factory_v1/requirements.txt
# or set ALPHA_FACTORY_FULL=1 when running `check_env.py --auto-install`
```

Detailed step‑by‑step instructions, including Colab usage,
are available in the [documentation](https://montrealai.github.io/AGI-Alpha-Agent-v0/).

For advanced options, see the [5‑Minute Quick‑Start](#6-5-minute-quick-start)
and [Docker Quickstart](#docker-quickstart) sections below.

### Running the Insight Demo

For the browser-based version, see
[insight_browser_v1/index.md](alpha_factory_v1/demos/alpha_agi_insight_v1/insight_browser_v1/index.md).
It requires **Node.js ≥22.17**. Install the dependencies with
`npm ci` and build the static assets with `npm run build` before launching.
The repository includes a `.nvmrc` file so you can simply run `nvm use` to
select the correct Node version.

The α‑AGI Insight demo ships with an offline‑friendly command line interface.
After installation, launch the official demo via:

```bash
alpha-agi-insight-v1 --episodes 5
# Or run directly from the package
python -m alpha_factory_v1.demos.alpha_agi_insight_v1 --episodes 5
```

When API keys are configured the program automatically uses the OpenAI Agents
runtime. Otherwise it falls back to the local Meta‑Agentic Tree Search.
The orchestrator also cleans up the OpenAI runtime on exit to release resources.

For production use, invoke the **official demo** which automatically
checks the environment, selects the best runtime and optionally starts the
Google ADK gateway:

```bash
alpha-agi-insight-v1 --episodes 5
```

This wrapper transparently falls back to the offline Meta‑Agentic Tree
Search when API credentials are absent, ensuring the demo runs anywhere.

For a guaranteed offline run without external dependencies, use:

```bash
AGI_INSIGHT_OFFLINE=1 alpha-agi-insight-v1 --episodes 5
```

Setting ``AGI_INSIGHT_OFFLINE=1`` ensures the search loop never attempts network access.

When the host cannot reach the internet the environment checker prints a warning
and the demos continue in offline mode using any cached data. Optional downloads
are skipped automatically.

Several demos ship with small CSV snapshots for offline mode. These samples
mirror data from the [demo-assets](https://github.com/MontrealAI/demo-assets)
repository and cover roughly March–April 2024.

### Meta-Agentic Tree Search Demo

An offline-friendly reference implementation focused on recursive agent-to-agent rewrites lives in
[meta_agentic_tree_search_v0/README.md](alpha_factory_v1/demos/meta_agentic_tree_search_v0/README.md).
It demonstrates the best‑first search behind the other examples and runs without external APIs.

<a name="63-offline-mode"></a>
### Offline Mode

Follow these steps when working without internet access. See the
[documentation](https://montrealai.github.io/AGI-Alpha-Agent-v0/) for a summary
of required environment variables.

1. **Build a wheelhouse** on a machine with connectivity:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/build_offline_wheels.sh
   ```
   The script collects all required wheels under `wheels/`. Copy this
   directory to the offline host, for example using `scp` or a USB drive:
   ```bash
   scp -r wheels user@offline-host:/path/to/AGI-Alpha-Agent-v0/
   ```
   Then set the environment variable on the target machine:
   ```bash
   export WHEELHOUSE="/path/to/AGI-Alpha-Agent-v0/wheels"
   ```

2. **Install from the wheelhouse** and verify packages. The setup script
   automatically uses a `wheels/` directory in the repository root when
   `WHEELHOUSE` is unset:
   ```bash
   AUTO_INSTALL_MISSING=1 ./codex/setup.sh
   python check_env.py --auto-install --wheelhouse "$WHEELHOUSE"
   pip check
   ```
  When network access is unavailable, install packages directly from the
  wheelhouse:
```bash
pip install --no-index --find-links "$WHEELHOUSE" -r requirements.txt
# Install demo extras offline
pip install --no-index --find-links "$WHEELHOUSE" -r \
  alpha_factory_v1/demos/era_of_experience/requirements.lock
```
 `check_env.py` uses the wheels under `$WHEELHOUSE`. Set
`WHEELHOUSE="$WHEELHOUSE"` when running `pre-commit` or the tests so
dependencies install from the local cache. See
[Offline Setup](alpha_factory_v1/scripts/README.md#offline-setup) for more
details. A short reference lives in the
[documentation](https://montrealai.github.io/AGI-Alpha-Agent-v0/). If package installation hangs
for more than ten minutes,
`check_env.py` will time out and suggest using `--wheelhouse` for
offline installs.

Run the environment check again when the machine is completely
air‑gapped:
```bash
python check_env.py --auto-install --wheelhouse "$WHEELHOUSE"
```
This mirrors the instructions in
[alpha_factory_v1/scripts/README.md](alpha_factory_v1/scripts/README.md#offline-setup).

See the [documentation](https://montrealai.github.io/AGI-Alpha-Agent-v0/)
for a concise summary of the wheelhouse setup.

3. **Download a `.gguf` weight** and set ``LLAMA_MODEL_PATH``:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.cache/llama
   curl -L -o ~/.cache/llama/TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0.Q4_K_M.gguf \
     https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-GGUF/resolve/main/TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0.Q4_K_M.gguf
   export LLAMA_MODEL_PATH=~/.cache/llama/TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0.Q4_K_M.gguf
   ```
   Common weights and typical CPU throughput:

   | Model | Size | ~tokens/s |
   |-------|------|-----------|
   | TinyLlama‑1.1B‑Chat Q4_K_M | 380 MB | ~20 |
   | Llama‑3‑8B‑Instruct Q4_K_M | 4 GB | ~5 |
   | Mixtral‑8×7B‑Instruct Q4_0 | 7 GB | ~3 |

   Install `llama-cpp-python` or `ctransformers` to enable offline inference.

4. **Fetch and build the browser assets** (requires **Node.js**) to run the Insight demo fully offline:
   ```bash
   cd alpha_factory_v1/demos/alpha_agi_insight_v1/insight_browser_v1
   npm run fetch-assets
   npm ci
   npm run build
   ```
   Skipping this step or running without Node.js prevents the service worker
   from being generated, so offline functionality is limited.
5. **Bundle Pyodide for offline demos**
   ```bash
   make gallery-build
   ```
   This command generates the `site/` directory with the Pyodide runtime and demo assets so the browser examples work without a network connection. The service worker caches these files. Use a hard refresh (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd>) or clear site data to pick up new releases.

6. **Skip browser downloads** when running the web demo tests offline:
   ```bash
   PLAYWRIGHT_SKIP_BROWSER_DOWNLOAD=1 npm test
   ```

7. **Enable offline inference** by setting ``AGI_INSIGHT_OFFLINE=1`` in
   ``.env`` or the environment (ensure `llama-cpp-python` or `ctransformers`
   is installed).

8. **Disable broadcasting** to avoid network calls:
   ```bash
   export AGI_INSIGHT_BROADCAST=0
   ```

9. **Seed the lineage database** from existing DGM logs using ``--import-dgm``.
   ```bash
   python -m alpha_factory_v1.demos.alpha_agi_insight_v1.src.interface.cli \
     simulate --import-dgm path/to/dgm/logs
   ```

   Sample sector definitions live in

   ``alpha_factory_v1/demos/alpha_agi_insight_v1/docs/sectors.sample.json``.
   Pass this file with ``--sectors-file`` to forecast specific industries.

   The built-in **Sector-Shock-10** dataset ships with the package and is
   located using ``importlib.resources`` when running the demo. This allows
   `simulate` to score forecasts even when the repository layout is not
   available.

Example (using ``--sectors-file`` to customise the simulation):

```bash
AGI_INSIGHT_OFFLINE=1 AGI_INSIGHT_BROADCAST=0 \
python -m alpha_factory_v1.demos.alpha_agi_insight_v1.src.interface.cli simulate \
  --curve linear --k 8 --x0 0.0 --llama-model-path "$LLAMA_MODEL_PATH" \
  --offline --energy 2.0 --entropy 0.5 \
  --mut-rate 0.1 --xover-rate 0.5 \
  --sectors-file alpha_factory_v1/demos/alpha_agi_insight_v1/docs/sectors.sample.json
```

Produces output similar to:

```

> **Mission 🎯**  Identify 🔍 → Learn 📚 → Think 🧠 → Design 🎨 → Strategise ♟️ → Execute ⚡ —
> compounding real‑world **α** across *all* industries.

Global markets seep *USD ✧ trillions/yr* in latent opportunity — “alpha” in the broadest sense:  
<kbd>pricing dislocations • supply‑chain entropy • novel drug targets • policy loopholes • undiscovered materials</kbd>.

**Alpha‑Factory v1** is an antifragile constellation of self‑improving Agentic α‑AGI Agents 👁️✨ orchestrated to **spot
live alpha across any industry and transmute it into compounding value**.

**Definition**: An **α‑AGI Business** 👁️✨ is an on‑chain autonomous enterprise (<name>.alpha.agi.eth) that unleashes a swarm
of self‑improving agentic **α‑AGI agents** 👁️✨ (<name>.alpha.agent.agi.eth) to hunt down inefficiencies across any domain
and transmute them into **$AGIALPHA**.

Built atop **OpenAI Agents SDK**, **Google ADK**, **A2A protocol**, and Anthropic’s **Model Context Protocol**, the
stack runs cloud‑native *or* air‑gapped, hot‑swapping between frontier LLMs and distilled local models.

### TL;DR Quick Start
Check out the `v0.1.0-alpha` tag for a reproducible environment.
```bash
git clone --branch v0.1.0-alpha https://github.com/MontrealAI/AGI-Alpha-Agent-v0.git
cd AGI-Alpha-Agent-v0
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
# Install runtime dependencies
# Install runtime dependencies
pip install -r requirements.lock  # pinned versions for deterministic setup
# Optional ADK/MCP integration
pip install google-adk mcp
# Requires Python 3.11–3.13 (<3.14)
./quickstart.sh
Run `pre-commit run --all-files` after the dependencies finish installing.
# Open http://localhost:8000/docs in your browser
```
The adapters initialise automatically when these optional packages are present.

### Optional Packages

Install these extras to unlock additional features:

- `pip install gradio` – enables the MuZero planning dashboard.
- `pip install openai-agents==0.0.17` – activates the official Agents runtime used for commentary.
- `pip install google-adk` and set `ALPHA_FACTORY_ENABLE_ADK=true` – starts the Google ADK gateway for
  cross‑organisation agent exchange.
- Install domain‑specific extras as needed (e.g. `httpx`, `feedparser`, `networkx`, `lightgbm`,
  `kafka-python`, `tldextract`). Each agent logs a warning when a library is missing and continues in
  degraded mode.

Offline installations can omit these lines from the relevant `requirements.txt`
files if the Agents SDK or ADK gateway are not needed.

To regenerate `requirements.lock` from `requirements.txt` with hashes, run:

```bash
pip-compile --generate-hashes --output-file requirements.lock requirements.txt
```

Once the API server is running you can launch a simulation:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/simulate \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"horizon": 5, "pop_size": 6, "generations": 3, "mut_rate": 0.1, "xover_rate": 0.5, "curve": "linear", "energy": 1.0, "entropy": 1.0}'
```

## Contributing
See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for the full contributor guide.

### Pre‑commit Hooks
After running `./codex/setup.sh`, which ensures `pre-commit==4.2.0`
is installed, install the hooks and run a full check:

```bash
# Install the exact version if the setup script didn't already
pip install pre-commit==4.2.0
pre-commit install
pre-commit run --all-files   # verify hooks after setup
pre-commit run --files <paths>   # before each commit
```
Run `pre-commit run --all-files` once after the setup script to confirm
everything is formatted correctly. These commands mirror the steps in
[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) and keep commits consistent.
After editing `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, run:

```bash
pre-commit run --files .github/workflows/ci.yml
python tools/update_actions.py
```
to validate the workflow with actionlint before committing.
Before opening a pull request, run `pre-commit run --all-files` to ensure
all hooks succeed.
Run `python check_env.py --auto-install` before invoking these commands so
optional hook dependencies are installed. When working offline, pass
`--wheelhouse <dir>` or set `WHEELHOUSE` to install from a local cache. If
`pre-commit` isn't found or the version differs, install it with
`pip install pre-commit==4.2.0`.

When editing the web UI, preserve existing ARIA labels so the interface
remains accessible.

### Development Setup
Install the Python dependencies with the helper script:

```bash
scripts/setup_env.sh
```
The script checks for Python 3.11–3.13 (<3.14) and installs `requirements.txt` and
`requirements-dev.txt`.

When preparing an offline environment, build a wheelhouse on a machine with
internet access:

```bash
./scripts/build_offline_wheels.sh
```

Copy the resulting `wheels/` directory to the target host and set
`WHEELHOUSE=$(pwd)/wheels` before running `check_env.py` or the tests so
packages install from the local cache. The repository does not ship these
prebuilt wheels.

The official Docker image bundles **PyTorch&nbsp;2.2.x** and **Ray&nbsp;2.10.0**. The
notebooks install PyTorch from the [PyTorch wheel index](https://download.pytorch.org/whl)
and pin Ray to the same version for compatibility.

  optimisation based on real performance metrics—contributions are
  warmly welcomed.
* **Note:** The `alpha_agi_business_3_v1` demo is intentionally left out of the published package. Clone this repository

## 6 · 5‑Minute Quick‑Start 🚀
This guide assumes the repository is cloned at `v0.1.0-alpha`. The walkthrough
requires the `numpy`, `yaml` and `pandas` packages which `check_env.py` installs
automatically when run with `--auto-install`.
```bash
git clone --branch v0.1.0-alpha https://github.com/MontrealAI/AGI-Alpha-Agent-v0.git
cd AGI-Alpha-Agent-v0
./quickstart.sh --preflight   # optional environment check
python check_env.py --auto-install  # verify & auto-install deps (10 min timeout)
# Install heavy optional packages such as openai_agents, gymnasium and google_adk.
# Running tests without these extras will skip or fail the modules that depend on
# them. Use ALPHA_FACTORY_FULL=1 with check_env.py to ensure they install. See
# `tests/README.md` for detailed instructions.
ALPHA_FACTORY_FULL=1 python check_env.py --auto-install
# Install runtime dependencies
pip install -r requirements.lock
# (If this fails with a network error, create a wheelhouse and rerun
#  with --wheelhouse <path> or place the wheels under ./wheels)
# Build a wheelhouse if the machine has no internet access:
#   ./scripts/build_offline_wheels.sh
./quickstart.sh               # creates venv, installs deps, launches
# Use `--wheelhouse /path/to/wheels` to install offline packages when
# the host has no internet access. The setup script automatically
# sets `WHEELHOUSE` to `./wheels` when that directory exists. When
# working offline, run `python check_env.py --auto-install --wheelhouse
# /path/to/wheels` to verify and install packages. The setup script
# exits with a message if neither network nor a wheelhouse are available.
# Example offline workflow:
#   export WHEELHOUSE=$(pwd)/wheels
#   python check_env.py --auto-install --wheelhouse "$WHEELHOUSE"
#   WHEELHOUSE=$WHEELHOUSE ./quickstart.sh
#   WHEELHOUSE=$WHEELHOUSE pytest -q
# Open http://localhost:8000/docs in your browser
# Alternatively, ``python alpha_factory_v1/quickstart.py`` provides the same
# workflow on Windows and other systems without Bash.

# Deploy instantly with Docker (prebuilt image)
docker run --pull=always -p 8000:8000 ghcr.io/montrealai/alpha-factory:latest

# Pull a specific build by commit SHA
docker run --pull=always -p 8000:8000 ghcr.io/montrealai/alpha-factory:<commit>

# The `alpha-factory` CLI also works when the package is installed:
# A short warning is printed before startup.
#   pip install -e .
#   alpha-factory --list-agents
#   alpha-asi-demo --demo   # launch the α‑ASI world‑model UI
#   alpha-agi-insight-v1 orchestrator   # run the Insight orchestrator
#
# Or install directly from GitHub for a quick test:
#   pip install git+https://github.com/MontrealAI/AGI-Alpha-Agent-v0.git@v0.1.0-alpha
#   alpha-factory --list-agents

# Automated one-click setup (builds & starts Docker stack)
./alpha_factory_v1/scripts/one_click_install.sh --deploy

# Verify the Ω‑Lattice demo locally
python alpha_factory_v1/demos/alpha_agi_business_3_v1/alpha_agi_business_3_v1.py --loglevel info
# The entrypoint automatically verifies dependencies via `check_env.py`.
```

Adjust `alpha_factory_v1/demos/alpha_asi_world_model/config.yaml` to tune the world-model loop. Key options include
`env_batch` (parallel environments), `hidden` (latent state size) and `mcts_simulations` (MCTS rollouts per action).


### Insight Browser Demo

A browser-only Pareto explorer lives under
`alpha_factory_v1/demos/alpha_agi_insight_v1/insight_browser_v1`.
Run `npm run build` in that directory to generate the `dist/` assets
(they are not stored in Git) then open `dist/index.html` to run the demo locally.
The quick-start guide is available from the
[documentation](https://montrealai.github.io/AGI-Alpha-Agent-v0/) and is copied
to `dist/insight_browser_quickstart.pdf` during the build so it is available
alongside the compiled assets.
Set `window.DEBUG = true` before loading the page to expose debugging helpers
such as `window.pop`.

For evolutionary experiments you can run the optional
[evolution worker](https://montrealai.github.io/AGI-Alpha-Agent-v0/) container
and POST a tarball of agent code to `/mutate`.

## Docker Quickstart
Start the full stack using Docker Compose:
```bash
docker compose up --build
```
Browse the dashboard at <http://localhost:8080>.

## One-Click Docker Quickstart
Run the minimal image directly:
```bash
./run_quickstart.sh
```
The script prints the project disclaimer, builds `docker/quickstart/Dockerfile`
and launches the container with your `.env` file mounted.

The same configuration can be installed via Helm:
```bash
helm upgrade --install alpha-demo ./infrastructure/helm-chart \
  --values ./infrastructure/helm-chart/values.yaml \
  --set env.RUN_MODE=web
```
This deploys the services to your local Kubernetes cluster.

Generate TLS certificates for the gRPC bus using the bundled helper:
```bash
./infrastructure/gen_bus_certs.sh > .env.bus
source .env.bus
```
The script prints `AGI_INSIGHT_BUS_CERT`, `AGI_INSIGHT_BUS_KEY` and
`AGI_INSIGHT_BUS_TOKEN` which you can append to your `.env` file.

### .env Setup & Security
Before running the orchestrator, copy `alpha_factory_v1/.env.sample` to `.env` and
replace all placeholder values with strong secrets. The sample sets
`NEO4J_PASSWORD=REPLACE_ME` as a placeholder—generate a random password for
services like Neo4j and Postgres using `openssl rand -base64 18` or a similar
tool and **never deploy with the defaults**. The orchestrator will refuse to
start if `NEO4J_PASSWORD` remains `REPLACE_ME` or is missing.
Set `API_TOKEN` to a strong secret so that the REST API can authenticate
incoming requests. Clients must send `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.
The server aborts if `API_TOKEN` equals `REPLACE_ME_TOKEN`.

#### API Token Requirement

Before starting the API server or running the test suite, ensure `API_TOKEN`
is set to a non-default value. The examples in `tests/test_api_status.py` use
`test-token` as a reference token for local runs.
Use `API_RATE_LIMIT` to limit requests per minute per IP (default `60`).
If more than 5% of requests return HTTP `429` within a minute, the server calls
`utils.alerts.send_alert` to report excessive throttling.
Avoid storing private keys directly in `.env`. Instead set
`AGI_INSIGHT_SOLANA_WALLET_FILE` to a file containing your hex-encoded wallet
key and keep that file readable only by the orchestrator.
To enable secure gRPC transport set `AGI_INSIGHT_BUS_CERT`,
`AGI_INSIGHT_BUS_KEY` and `AGI_INSIGHT_BUS_TOKEN`. If these values are
omitted and `AGI_INSIGHT_ALLOW_INSECURE=1`, the bus starts without TLS.
See the [documentation](https://montrealai.github.io/AGI-Alpha-Agent-v0/)
for instructions and example volume mounts.

`.env.sample` notes that paths on Windows may require quotes (e.g., `C:\\path\\to\\file`).

#### Troubleshooting Asset Downloads

If `scripts/fetch_assets.py` or `npm run fetch-assets` returns `401` or `404`,
download the checkpoint directly:

```bash
python scripts/download_hf_gpt2.py models/gpt2
# Or fetch manually from Hugging Face
curl -O https://huggingface.co/openai-community/gpt2/resolve/main/pytorch_model.bin
curl -O https://huggingface.co/openai-community/gpt2/resolve/main/vocab.json
curl -O https://huggingface.co/openai-community/gpt2/resolve/main/merges.txt
curl -O https://huggingface.co/openai-community/gpt2/resolve/main/config.json
```

For a production-ready ADK setup see
[PRODUCTION_GUIDE.md](alpha_factory_v1/demos/alpha_agi_business_v1/PRODUCTION_GUIDE.md).

### Finance Demo Quick‑Start

Launch the finance alpha demo directly from your terminal:

```bash
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MontrealAI/AGI-Alpha-Agent-v0/main/alpha_factory_v1/demos/finance_alpha/deploy_alpha_factory_demo.sh | bash
```

The script pulls the signed demo container, runs a BTC/GLD strategy, prints open
positions and P&L, and exposes the trace‑graph UI at
<http://localhost:${TRACE_WS_PORT}>.

Need a different pair or port? Use environment variables:
`STRATEGY=my_pair PORT_API=8001 TRACE_WS_PORT=9000 bash deploy_alpha_factory_demo.sh`

No GPU → falls back to GGML Llama‑3‑8B‑Q4.
No `OPENAI_API_KEY` → switches to local SBERT + heuristics.
`AF_LLM_CACHE_SIZE` caps in-memory LLM cache entries (default 1024).
`AF_PING_INTERVAL` sets the ping frequency in seconds (default 60, minimum 5).
`AF_DISABLE_PING_AGENT=true` disables the built‑in ping agent.

### 6.1 · Running Tests 🧪

Unit tests can be executed with the bundled helper script:

```bash
python -m alpha_factory_v1.scripts.run_tests
```

Always run `python check_env.py --auto-install` beforehand so optional
dependencies like `openai_agents` and `gymnasium` are present. Use
`ALPHA_FACTORY_FULL=1` to install heavy extras.

The helper validates the target directory, prefers `pytest` when
available and otherwise falls back to `unittest`. Ensure all tests pass
before deploying changes.

Install the optional test dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
pip install -r requirements.lock  # pinned versions for deterministic setup
pip install -r alpha_factory_v1/backend/requirements-lock.txt  # includes RDKit
```

Install the project in editable mode so tests resolve imports:
```bash
pip install -e .
python check_env.py --auto-install  # times out after 10 minutes
# Install heavier extras so tests needing torch or faiss work:
ALPHA_FACTORY_FULL=1 python check_env.py --auto-install
```
The `run_tests` helper automatically executes `python check_env.py --auto-install`
before running `pytest`. When offline, set `WHEELHOUSE` or pass
`--wheelhouse <dir>` so packages install from the local wheel cache. The
repository ships with a `wheels/` directory that can be used as this cache.
The full test suite relies on optional packages including `numpy`, `torch`,
`pandas`, `prometheus_client`, `gymnasium`, `playwright`, `httpx`, `uvicorn`,
`git`, `hypothesis` and `requests_mock`.

Tests that depend on optional heavy packages skip automatically when those
libraries are missing. Set environment variables like `SKIP_WEBKIT_TESTS=1`
or `PYTEST_NET_OFF=1` to bypass browser or network tests if the necessary
dependencies aren't installed.

#### Wheelhouse Setup

Tests install packages from PyPI unless a local wheelhouse is provided. Build
one from `requirements.lock` and point `WHEELHOUSE` to it before verifying the
environment and running the suite:

```bash
mkdir -p wheels
pip wheel -r requirements.lock -w wheels
export WHEELHOUSE=$(pwd)/wheels
python check_env.py --auto-install --wheelhouse "$WHEELHOUSE"
WHEELHOUSE="$WHEELHOUSE" pytest -q
```

If network access is unavailable and the variable is unset these commands fail
instead of falling back to PyPI.

#### Offline or Restricted Environments

Run `./scripts/build_offline_wheels.sh` to populate a wheelhouse on a
machine with internet access, then set `WHEELHOUSE=<path>` before executing
the tests so dependencies install from this local cache.
If `npx playwright install` fails to download WebKit, set `SKIP_WEBKIT_TESTS=1`
so browser checks skip gracefully.

#### Test Runtime

Running `pytest` may take several minutes on the first run while caches are
created. Execute the suite in verbose mode to see ongoing progress:

```bash
pytest -vv
```

After completion `pytest` prints a summary such as `### passed in 120.00s`.

The suite includes `tests/test_api_rate_limit.py` which spins up
`api_server.app` with `API_RATE_LIMIT=2` and verifies that exceeding the
limit returns HTTP `429`.

### 6.2 · Marketplace Demo Example 🛒
A minimal snippet queues the sample job once the orchestrator is running:

```bash
alpha-factory --enabled finance,manufacturing &
python - <<'PY'
import subprocess, time
from alpha_factory_v1.demos import alpha_agi_marketplace_v1 as market
time.sleep(5)
subprocess.run(["bash", str(market.POST_JOB_SCRIPT), str(market.SAMPLE_JOB)], check=True)
marketplace_args = ["python", "-m", "alpha_factory_v1.demos.alpha_agi_marketplace_v1.marketplace", str(market.SAMPLE_JOB)]
subprocess.run(marketplace_args, check=True)
PY
```

---

### 6.2 · Cross-Industry Demo Quick‑Start 🌐
Clone the stable `v0.1.0-alpha` release:
```bash
git clone --branch v0.1.0-alpha https://github.com/MontrealAI/AGI-Alpha-Agent-v0.git
cd AGI-Alpha-Agent-v0/alpha_factory_v1/demos/cross_industry_alpha_factory
# Set AUTO_COMMIT=1 to save generated assets back to the repo
./deploy_alpha_factory_cross_industry_demo.sh
```

---

### 6.3 · Signing Agent Wheels 🔑
Sign wheels dropped into `$AGENT_HOT_DIR` with the project ED25519 key.
You need **OpenSSL** to create and verify signatures. Install it with
`brew install openssl` on macOS or from the
[OpenSSL Windows binaries](https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html).
Generate `<wheel>.whl.sig` via:

```bash
openssl dgst -sha512 -binary <wheel>.whl |
  openssl pkeyutl -sign -inkey agent_signing.key |
  base64 -w0 > <wheel>.whl.sig
```

Keep `<wheel>.whl.sig` next to the wheel in `$AGENT_HOT_DIR`.

Verify the signature (PowerShell example):

```powershell
Get-Content <wheel>.whl -Encoding Byte |
  openssl dgst -sha512 -binary |
  openssl pkeyutl -verify -pubin -inkey $env:AGENT_WHEEL_PUBKEY -sigfile <wheel>.whl.sig
```

Add the base64 signature to `_WHEEL_SIGS` in
`alpha_factory_v1/backend/agents/__init__.py`. Wheels failing verification are
ignored.

### 6.4 · Web Dashboard Quick-Start 📊
Launch the local web interface:
```bash
uvicorn alpha_factory_v1.demos.alpha_agi_insight_v1.src.interface.api_server:app --reload
streamlit run alpha_factory_v1/demos/alpha_agi_insight_v1/src/interface/web_app.py
# React client
cd alpha_factory_v1/demos/alpha_agi_insight_v1/src/interface/web_client
npm ci          # use the lock file for reproducible installs
npm run dev       # http://localhost:5173
# build production assets
npm run build
python -m http.server --directory dist 9000
```
Alternatively run inside Docker:
```bash
# build the web client first so `dist/` exists
make build_web
# regenerate protobuf modules and Go stubs
./tools/gen_proto_stubs.sh  # updates alpha_factory_v1/core/utils/a2a_pb2.py and tools/go_a2a_client/a2a.pb.go
make compose-up  # builds and waits for healthy services
```
Run `./tools/gen_proto_stubs.sh` whenever `alpha_factory_v1/core/utils/a2a.proto` changes to keep the
Python and Go stubs up to date.
Open <http://localhost:8080> in your browser. When `RUN_MODE=web`, the container
serves the static files from `alpha_factory_v1/demos/alpha_agi_insight_v1/src/interface/web_client/dist` using `python -m
http.server`. The FastAPI demo also mounts this folder at `/` when present so the
dashboard is reachable without additional tooling.

Once running, Docker Compose marks the services **healthy** when:

- `http://localhost:8000/healthz` returns status `200` for the orchestrator container.
- `http://localhost:8000/status` exposes agent heartbeats and restart counts.
  Use `alpha-agi-insight-v1 agents-status` to view the same data from the CLI.
- `http://localhost:8080/` returns status `200` for the web container.

The dashboard now plots a 3‑D scatter chart of effectiveness vs. risk vs.
complexity from the final population.

If Streamlit isn't installed or you're running on a headless server, use:
```bash
python -m alpha_factory_v1.demos.alpha_agi_insight_v1.src.interface.minimal_ui --text
```
to display the forecast results directly in the console.

## 7 · Deployment Recipes 🍳
The repository bundles a lightweight `edge_runner.py` helper for running
Alpha‑Factory on air‑gapped or resource‑constrained devices. The script
forwards to `alpha_factory_v1.edge_runner` and exposes additional flags
like `--cycle`, `--loglevel` and `--version`.
It prints the same warning as the main CLI before launching.

Build the demo containers locally:

```bash
cp .env.sample .env  # fill in NEO4J_PASSWORD, API_TOKEN and optional PINNER_TOKEN
chmod 600 alpha_factory_v1/.env
cd infrastructure
docker build -t alpha-demo .
docker compose up -d
# Dashboard available at <http://localhost:8080>
```

The Compose stack restricts the agents worker using Docker resource limits. The
`agents` service runs with `mem_limit: 8g`, `pids_limit: 512` and
`network_mode: none` to prevent outbound traffic.

The Helm chart under `infrastructure/helm-chart` mirrors this Compose
setup:

```bash
helm upgrade --install alpha-demo ./infrastructure/helm-chart \
  --values ./infrastructure/helm-chart/values.yaml \
  --set env.RUN_MODE=web
# Enable persistent storage for the audit ledger
#   --set persistence.enabled=true --set persistence.size=5Gi
# → browse to <http://localhost:8080>
```

`values.example.yaml` demonstrates typical overrides such as API tokens, service ports and replica counts.

The Helm charts ship with placeholders like `NEO4J_PASSWORD` and
`adminPassword` set to `REPLACE_ME`. Replace these with strong secrets
in `values.yaml` or via `--set` before deploying.

Terraform scripts in `infrastructure/terraform` provide GCP and AWS
examples. Update the placeholder image and networking variables,
then initialise and apply:

```bash
cd infrastructure/terraform
terraform init
terraform apply
```

### 🚀 Deploying securely
See the [documentation](https://montrealai.github.io/AGI-Alpha-Agent-v0/) for TLS setup, API tokens and Vault usage. Mount secrets
via Docker or Kubernetes and never commit them.

| Signal | Sink | Example |
|--------|------|---------|
| Metrics | Prometheus | `alpha_pnl_realised_usd` |
| Traces | OpenTelemetry | `trace_id` |
| Dashboards | Grafana | `alpha-factory/trade-lifecycle.json` |

Prometheus scrapes metrics from the API server at `/metrics`.

By default traces and metrics print to ``stdout``. To export to a collector such
as **Jaeger**, set ``OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`` and start Jaeger locally:

```bash
docker run -p 16686:16686 -p 4317:4317 jaegertracing/all-in-one
```

Set ``OTEL_ENDPOINT`` to enable anonymous dashboard telemetry. Users are
prompted for consent before any metrics are sent.

### Telemetry Queue
Anonymous usage metrics are buffered in the browser under the
`telemetryQueue` key in `localStorage`. Each record includes:

- `ts` – the timestamp when the entry was recorded.
- `session` – a deterministic SHA‑256 hash identifying the session.
- `generations` – how many runs were executed.
- `shares` – how many times results were shared.

When the browser is online the queue is flushed to ``OTEL_ENDPOINT`` using
`navigator.sendBeacon` with a `fetch` fallback. The queue holds at most 100
entries and is persisted across page loads until sent. No personal data or IP
addresses are stored.

Telemetry can be disabled from the Analytics panel by clicking **Disable
telemetry**. Clearing the `telemetryConsent` and `telemetryQueue` entries in
browser storage also stops all transmissions.

## 14 · Credits 🌟

[Vincent Boucher](https://www.linkedin.com/in/montrealai/)—pioneer in AI and President of
[MONTREAL.AI](https://www.montreal.ai/) since 2003—dominated the
[OpenAI Gym](https://web.archive.org/web/20170929214241/https://gym.openai.com/read-only.html) with **AI Agents**
in 2016 and unveiled the seminal [**“Multi‑Agent AI DAO”**](https://www.quebecartificialintelligence.com/priorart)
in 2017.

Our **AGI ALPHA AGENT**, fuelled by the strictly‑utility **$AGIALPHA** token, now taps that foundation to unleash the
ultimate α‑signal engine.

### AGIALPHA Token

- **Address:** `0xa61a3b3a130a9c20768eebf97e21515a6046a1fa`
- **Decimals:** `18` (ERC‑20 standard; 1 token = 1e18 base units)
- **Config defaults:** `token.config.js` pins the token wiring for builds and
  tests; override with `AGIALPHA_ADDRESS` / `AGIALPHA_DECIMALS` environment
  variables when deploying to alternate networks.

#### ERC‑20 Approvals

Staking and job escrow pull funds via `transferFrom`, so each account must
`approve` the `StakeManager` contract before staking or posting a job. `$AGIALPHA`
uses 18 decimals, meaning `1e18` represents one token.

```bash
# Allow the StakeManager to move 100 AGIALPHA for your stake
cast send 0xa61a3b3a130a9c20768eebf97e21515a6046a1fa \
  "approve(address,uint256)" $STAKEMANAGER 100e18

# Authorize 50 AGIALPHA to be locked as job escrow
cast send 0xa61a3b3a130a9c20768eebf97e21515a6046a1fa \
  "approve(address,uint256)" $STAKEMANAGER 50e18
```

Replace `$STAKEMANAGER` with the deployed contract address.
